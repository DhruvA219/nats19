<p> If you google <b>“enormous blaze” rubik’s cube </b> or  <b> “approaching cloud” rubik’s cube </b> , you can find that these refer to the chinese meanings of Dayan Taiyan and Dayan Lingyun. These are the 1st and 3rd cubes in the Dayan 3x3 series. Bird spreads its wings is the meaning of Dayan Zhanchi, the 5th cube in the Dayan 3x3 Series. </p>

<p>So we are talking of a cube before which is the 1st cube, after which is the 3rd cube, and the 5th cube is in some distance. This is a reference to the second Dayan 3x3 Cube, which is Guhong. Note that Guhong itself means “Lone Goose” and the last line is a reinforcing hint. </p>

<p>The answer is Dayan Guhong or Guhong.
