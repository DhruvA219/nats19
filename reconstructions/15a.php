<p> The hint asks you to construct a URL. <br>
The image is that of youtube. <br>
The anonymous quote says that "You matter only if you are the first character at something." <br>
If you look at the first character of the message present: <br>
<b<U<b>ltimate <b>-</b> <b>r</b>ubiks <b>c</b>ube <b>P</b>resented <b>A</b>t <b>s</b>outh <b>Y</b>amunanagar <b>5</b> <b>b</b>efore <b>Y</b>ears.</p>

<p>You get U-rcPAsY5bY. </p>

<p>Youtube video URLs generally look something like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= . Note that the image of youtube itself is not just an image but a link to the exact same URL.<br>

So if you append the message we just extracted to the youtube URL, you get <br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-rcPAsY5bY<br>

The answer to this question is the time of the solve in the youtube video: 0.49
