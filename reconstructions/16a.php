<p> The question says that for over the past 8 years, people have committed to something. <br>
The first line says something about a sequence of letters which refers to scrambles. <br>
Now, developers use github to maintain code which is used for cubing related activities. TNoodle is used as the official WCA scramble generator for all WCA approved events. <br>
It has a github repository/webpage where developers “commit” their changes. Not all of you may know what is Github, but if you google the words TNoodle and committed together, that is the first result. <br></p>

<p>The last commit was made by campos20  (Alexandre Henrique Afonso Campos) and that is the answer.
