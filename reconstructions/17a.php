If you google 'Chuck Red Leonard', you get some reference to Angry Birds characters. <br>
Red is the red bird. <br>
Chuck is the yellow bird. <br>
Leonard is the green pig. <br> </p>

<p>If you look at the Nats19 schedule, you will see that three of these colours correspond to the 3 colours of the stages. <br>

Red corresponds to stage 1. <br>
Yellow corresponds to stage 2. <br>
Green corresponds to stage 3. </p>

<p>The first line means that Nats starts with these 3 stages all being used. <br>
The last two lines say that at the extreme end, red is not there anymore. <br>
That means stage 1 is not used at the extreme end (last round or finals). <br>
There is only one such event for which Red, Yellow and Green stages are used in Round 1 but red is not used in Finals. That is Clock. <br></p>

<p>The answer is thus, Clock.
