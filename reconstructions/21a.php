<p> The quote talks about navigation and there is a a pair of 2 phrases in bracket separated by a comma. You need to use this information to understand that we are talking about coordinates here. </p>

<p>333 is the event ID of 3x3x3 Cube and 1^2 refers to Square-1. <br>
You need to get the single results of these competitors in the said events and do the math to get the coordinates. Andy Denney has a 5.49 3x3 Single and Shane Grogan has 6.89. Thus the first term in the bracket is (- 5.49 * 6.89) = (-37. 8261). <br>Similarly, by taking the Square-1 single results of Lorenzo Layug and Peter Preston, you can get another number. </p>

<p>Once you visit these coordinates using google maps or some other software, you will find that these are coordinates to the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, which is the venue for World Championship 2019.</p>

<p>Melbourne, the full venue name, World Championship 2019 are all acceptable answers. </p>
