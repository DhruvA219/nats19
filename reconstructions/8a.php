<p> This was a pretty straightforward one. The word “Architect” might ring a bell to all those familiar with Erno Rubik, the inventor of the Rubik’s cube. He is Hungarian architect and professor of architecture. <br>
Magdolna is his mother’s name. And he invented the Rubik’s cube in 1974 (which coincidentally is his current age too).  <br>
The answer is Erno Rubik.
